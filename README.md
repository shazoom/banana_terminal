Open a terminal and change directory (cd) to the result found by searching with Alfred limiting itself to folders.   

This workflow uses some code from https://github.com/raguay/MyAlfred/blob/master/AlfredBrowserToolbox.alfredworkflow and https://github.com/LeEnno/alfred-terminalfinder.

I don‚Äôt like tabs for terminals so it is intentional that each terminal is in its own window. If you want to see a script with support for opening in tabs, take a look at https://github.com/LeEnno/alfred-terminalfinder.

	bt 	‚Üí searches for a dircectory and opens it in a terminal
	bf 	‚Üí searches for a directory and opens it in a finder
	bft ‚Üí opens a terminal with the current directory which finder shows
	btf ‚Üí opens a finder showing the current directory in your terminal

Set the variable term_type (click on the "Configure workflow and variables" button [ùìç]) to "Terminal" (without quoates) to work with Terminal.app or "iTerm2" to work with iTerm2.app. The scripts will only work with recent version of iTerm2 which implement the newer applescript API.

Enjoy bananas.
